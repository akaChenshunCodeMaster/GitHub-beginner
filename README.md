# GitHub-beginner

Hey! I am Chenshun Hong. This is somewhere I wanna learn GitHub on my own and share my understanding here.
Thanks for your checking!

1. Set up local environment:
	dowload Git
	git --version #to get the latest version of git
	git config --global user.name "" #your GitHub user name
	git config --global user,email "" #your GitHub email address
	git config --list

2. Create repo online in the GitHub website
3. Download GitHub Desktop and sign in
4. Clone the repo locally 
5. After changing anything, commit, then push
6. when you want the latest one, pull from the desktop version

this is a branch trial, see something different in branch
